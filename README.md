The logic behind a Match 3 game involves the following steps:

1. **Game Initialization**: Set up the game board by creating a two-dimensional array representing the grid of gems. Fill each cell of the array with a randomly selected gem color.

2. **Gem Swapping**: Allow the player to swap adjacent gems by clicking on them. Implement logic to handle gem swapping, ensuring that valid swaps are made.

3. **Matching**: After each swap, check the game board for matches. A match occurs when three or more gems of the same color are horizontally or vertically adjacent to each other.

4. **Match Removal**: Once matches are found, remove the matched gems from the game board. Set those cells to a null or empty value to indicate the absence of a gem.

5. **Gem Shifting**: Shift the gems above the removed matches to fill the empty spaces. Move each gem downwards to fill the gaps created by the removal.

6. **Gem Filling**: After shifting, fill the topmost row with new randomly generated gems to replace the empty cells. This fills the board with new gems and ensures that the grid is complete.

7. **Score Calculation**: Calculate the player's score based on the length of the matches made. Assign a specific score value to each gem and multiply it by the length of the match to determine the score earned.

8. **Moves and Game Over**: Track the number of moves remaining for the player. Once the moves reach zero, the game is over. You can also add other conditions for game over, such as a time limit or specific objectives.

To code this logic in JavaScript, you'll need to create functions for each step and update the game state accordingly. Here's a general outline of how you can implement the code:

1. Create a two-dimensional array (`board`) to represent the game board. Initialize it with random gem colors.

2. Implement the gem swapping functionality. Use event listeners to handle gem clicks and swap gems accordingly.

3. Write a function to check for matches on the game board. Iterate through each cell and check for horizontal and vertical matches of at least three gems of the same color.

4. Implement the match removal logic. Once matches are found, remove the matched gems from the board by setting their values to null or empty.

5. Write functions for shifting the remaining gems downwards and filling the empty spaces with new gems.

6. Calculate and update the player's score based on the length of the matches made. Keep track of the score and display it on the screen.

7. Track the number of moves remaining and update it after each valid swap. Implement game over conditions when the moves reach zero or other specific objectives are met.

These are the basic steps to implement a Match 3 game in JavaScript. You can further enhance the game by adding animations, sound effects, levels, and power-ups.
